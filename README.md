# N-Queen Puzzle Solver -

## Overview
Welcome to the N-Queen Puzzle Solver. This project provides an interactive and educational tool to understand the classic N-Queen puzzle. Users can specify the number of queens, and the solver will calculate all possible solutions, displaying them one by one with animation. You can control the animation speed to follow the solving process easily.

## Features
- Specify the number of queens (N) for the puzzle.
- Calculate the total number of possible solutions.
- Visualize solutions one by one in an animated format.
- Adjust the speed of the solving animation.
- Interactive interface for easy learning and understanding.


## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrashantPKP/N-Queen-Puzzle-Solver.git
    cd N-Queen-Puzzle-Solver
    ```

2. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the N-Queen Puzzle Solver.

## Code Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the web page.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic for solving the N-Queen puzzle and handling animations.


## How it Works

1. The user inputs the desired number of queens (N)
2. The program calculates all possible solutions for the given N
3. Solutions are displayed on a chessboard, one at a time
4. The solving process is animated, showing queen placements step by step
5. Users can control the speed of the animation to suit their learning pace

## Usage

1. Run the program
2. Enter the number of queens when prompted
3. Watch the animated solutions
4. Use the speed controls to adjust the animation speed
5. Navigate through different solutions

## Benefits
